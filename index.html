            <h3> and software <span class="span4"> programming </span></h3>
            <p>My name is Carlos Mario Londo√±o. I'm from Colombia, I'm 20 years old and I'm currently studying software development, just 1 year ago I finished my military service specializing in lethal and non-lethal weaponry becoming the best in my group.<br class="br">I was given the opportunity to study something that I always found curious and a world that I always wanted to know and fill me with knowledge which was programming.
            I decided to study programming thanks to my best friend, he insisted that I should study software programming both for the challenge of learning and for the opportunities it would give me, so now I continue studying and without giving up.
